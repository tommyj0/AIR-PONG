# TODO

- Port to SFML 2.6.1: get rid of all the deprecated warnings

- Add ToF input as an alternative to keyboard

- Use CMake or write the makefile properly: currently just a one liner

- Separate platform specific calls to make portable (easier to integrate with [RV32-CPU](https://github.com/tommyj0/RV32-CPU))
